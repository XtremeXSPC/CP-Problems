# A modern and clean .clang-tidy configuration file.

# Defines which checks to enable. The '-' at the beginning disables all checks,
# then specific groups are re-enabled. This is a common and effective pattern.
Checks: "-*,clang-analyzer-*,performance-*,bugprone-*,readability-*,portability-*,modernize-*"

# Specify a list of warnings to treat as errors. Empty means none.
# Example: "bugprone-use-after-move"
WarningsAsErrors: ""

# A regular expression that tells clang-tidy to only report issues
# in files from source directories (e.g., 'include' and 'src').
# This prevents warnings from system headers or third-party libraries.
HeaderFilterRegex: "^(include|src)/.*"

# Allows fine-tuning specific checks.
CheckOptions:
  - key: readability-identifier-naming.VariableCase
    value: camelCase

# Tells clang-tidy to not apply any formatting fixes.
# Formatting is better handled by a dedicated tool like clang-format.
FormatStyle: none
