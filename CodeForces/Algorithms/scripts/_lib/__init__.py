"""Cross-cutting infrastructure shared by Algorithms/scripts/.

Modules in this package are deliberately *low-level* and dependency-free
within the scripts tree (no flattener, workflow_manager, etc.). They model
the building blocks every script reaches for: subprocess execution, common
result types, and stable error categories.

External users should import from the public re-exports of the consuming
modules (e.g. ``workflow_manager_core``) rather than reaching into ``_lib``
directly — the leading underscore signals an internal package boundary.
